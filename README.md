# object-detection
This source code contains an API that detects the coordinates of the bounding boxes of a twitter image posted to it using the machine learning code below:

https://github.com/steven4354/object_detection_twitter

It was built using flask

To make use of this API:

  * Clone the model from the above repo
  
  * Run the code
  
  * Download the model folder
  
  * Clone this repo
  
  * Save the model folder in thesame directory as app.py
  
  * Install the dependencies in requirement.txt and be sure to follow through the instructions on the installation of tensorflow models         "https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md"


This is a submission to BitBroker labs as part of an interview process for an internship on machine learning
